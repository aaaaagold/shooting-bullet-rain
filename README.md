# shooting-bullet-rain, just download and play!!

It's a shooting game written mainly in javascript.

There is also a score record server. You can host it yourself.

## platform

Chrome, Firefox, IE11, Edge

Some parts of codes use "const", and I realize some browsers don't support.

FPS may different according to the browser you use.

If you have a powerful computer, you can reduce the value of "consts.updatePeriod" in "js/_script-conf.js"

## how to play

Drag "index.html" to your browser

## server.js? score record server?

"server/server.js" is the score record server. Use node(nodejs) to run it at "server" folder
